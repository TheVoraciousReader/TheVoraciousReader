## Hey everyone, this is Shwetha!

# A Little About Me

I remember the day my dad had bought home one of those old timey monitors. I've always been a tinkerer by nature and from then on, through the Internet, the world became my oyster. Subsequently, I chose to pursue a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently, I'm working as a software engineer with around 3 years of experience.

In my free time, you can find me reading books, solving puzzles, building stuff or enjoying a nice cup of tea.

# Tech Stack

I love to tinker around with a few languages, but my primary tech stack would be the following:

- Node.js
- React
- Typescript
- Next.js

# Let's Connect!

I'm always open to connecting with like minded folks.
